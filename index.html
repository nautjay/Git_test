            This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if the page is a long one it might be split up in to several sub-headings.

        <h2>
            This is a sub-heading
        </h2>
        <p>
            Many long articles have sub-headings to help you follow the structure of what being written. There may be even sub-sub-headings (or lower level headings).
