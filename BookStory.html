            Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, <i>lying</i> between the copies of <cite>Nature, New scientist</cite>, and all the other <br>
            scientific journals her work has appeared in, was a well thumbed <cite>copy of On the Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she <br>
            spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.

            She had spent the last 10 years in this room, sitting  under a  poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of  people who have <br>
            nothing better to do.</q> Although many considered her pionering work, unravelling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly,<br>
            <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
