            Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, <i>lying</i> between the copies of <cite>Nature, New scientist</cite>, and all the other <br>
            scientific journals her work has appeared in, was a well thumbed <cite>copy of On the Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she <br>
            spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
        </p>
        <p>
            She had spent the last 10 years in this room, sitting  under a  poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of  people who have <br>
            nothing better to do.</q> Although many considered her pionering work, unravelling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly,<br>
            <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.

        <h4>Recipe For Scrambled Eggs</h4>
        <p>Eggs are one of my favorite foods. Here is a recipe for deliciously rich scrambled eggs.</p>
        <h3>Ingridients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tbs butter</li>
            <li>2 tbs cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Melt butter in a frying pan in a medium heat</li>
                <li>Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl</li>
                <li>Once butter has melted add cream and eggs</li>
                <li>Using a spatula fold the eggs from the edge of the pan to the center every 20 seconds (as if you are making omelette)</li>
                <li>When eggs are still moist remove from the heat (it will continue to cook on the plate until served)</li>
            </ol>
